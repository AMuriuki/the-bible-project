# Domain-Driven Design
## Intro
The premise of Domain-Drive Design is:<br>
* Placing the project's primary focus on the core domain and domain logic
* Basing complex designs on a model of the domain
* Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems

## Definitions
**domain**<br>A sphere of knowledge, influence, or activity. The subject area to which the user applies a program is the domain of the software. For **'The Bible Project'** the Bible is that sphere of knowledge, influence and activity (subject area) that user's will be applying the application/software.
